    "It is well known that an excessive alcohol consumption can cause the increased risk of health problems. However, alcoholic beverages are highly available in any european country and the majority of people can not imagine a party without an alcohol. A lot of people believe that moderate alcohol intake can actually help them to release stress and feel more relaxed. But others avoid alcohol consumption not to harm their physical and psychological health. This project aims to reveal the truth - **is there a relation between the frequency of alcohol consumption and current depressive symptoms in Europe?**\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The interactive plot showed that three countries which have the largest percentage of population drinking alcohol on daily basis are PT (Portugal, almost 40%!), ES (Spain) and IT (Italy) in 2014. Other three countries which population never consumes alcohol are CY (Cyprus, about 45%), HR(Croatia) and IT (Italy) in 2014.\n",
    "Plot doesn't show any noticeable correlation between the development of depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption (as well as the t-test). It also proves that there is the correlation between the educational level and the development of depressive symptoms (the one-way ANOVA test) - the higher the education level the smaller amount of population struggles with depressive symptoms. It also can be seen that most people consume alcohol several times per month or monthly.\n",
